## Project title

ut

## Description

ut is a hack of the linux Unreal Tournament (UT99) startup scipt. The startup script was modified to be able to load Unreal Tournament maps from the commandline or file management applications. An addition has been made to get the correct gametype as this isn't always specified correctly by the map.

The modified script can be considered done. No documentation is available.

The modified script has been used a lot to satisfaction
