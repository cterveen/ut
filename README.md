## Project title

ut

## Description

ut is a hack of the linux Unreal Tournament (UT99) startup scipt. The startup script was modified to be able to load Unreal Tournament maps from the commandline or file management applications. An addition has been made to get the correct gametype as this isn't always specified correctly by the map.

The modified script can be considered finished and has been used a lot. No documentation is available.

No further development is intended.

## Installation

Backup the original ut start script.

Overwrite the original ut start script with the ut file.

## Usage

`ut CTF-2on2-Crates.unr`

## Credits

Original Linux start script by Loki

## License
